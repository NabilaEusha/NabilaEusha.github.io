        <p>
            Beyond academics, I'm deeply interested in competitive programming, where I've solved over 500 problems on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. I enjoy participating in hackathons and coding challenges that push the boundaries of technology. My hobbies include reading science fiction, playing chess, and exploring new programming languages. I'm also passionate about mentoring fellow students and contributing to open-source projects.
